# PyBer_Analysis

#Overview of the analysis: 
Purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.



#Results: 
Summary data frame shows Total Rides, Total number of drivers, Total fares, Average fare per ride, average fair per driver. 
Total number of rides are less in rural cites as compared to Urban and suburban cities but average fare per ride and average fare per driver is more in rural cities as compared to Urban and suburban cities.
Urban cities has majority of total rides as compared to rural and suburban cities but has less average fare per ride and average fare per driver

#Summary:
1) Average Fare per Ride has different values in rural, suburban and urban cities. People in rural cities might not be using this facilitiy due to high prices. Prices should be affordable for all people.
2) If we try to balance price according to lifestyle and type of city, we might not see this disparity.Drivers are earning less according to the urban city's lifestyle and payscale.
3) Make more number of rides avalilable in rural cities so that more onumber of poeple can take advatage of this facility.
