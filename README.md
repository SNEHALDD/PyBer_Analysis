#Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.



#Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Summary data frame shows Total Rides, Total number of drivers, Total fares, Average fare per ride, average fair per driver.
